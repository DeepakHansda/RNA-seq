When we do differential analysis in a Rna-seq expreiments we often do it in case vs control setting. We also know the sources of variation between these sample types. These sources of variations can be a drug treatment, certain phenotypic difference (cancerous vs healthy) etc. But on most of occasions we have some known and expected sources or variations such as experiments permormed on different batches, temparature of the day a particular experiments was performed etc. These kinds of variations are not biological rather technical in nature, and may impact the results of an Rna-seq experiment.  

So while dealing with the technical reasons, basically two possible scenario can occur; 1) one in which we know the sources of variations. 2) Secondly, we have only the count tables corresponding to case and control and the sources variation explain only a small proportions of the differnces between case and control. Package `DESeq2` has the ability to address above two situations.

We will discuss above two scenario. for that we obtain a count matrix and column meta data of 6 healthy heart and 6 failing heart samples from package `compGenomRData`.

```r
counts_file <- system.file('extdata/rna-seq/SRP021193.raw_counts.tsv',
                           package = 'compGenomRData')
colData_file <- system.file('extdata/rna-seq/SRP021193.colData.tsv',
                            package = 'compGenomRData')
                            
counts <- read.table(counts_file)
colData <- read.table(colData_file, header = T, sep = '\t',
                                  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

We can have a look at how the samples cluster together(motivation again, is to check if the similar samples cluter together). For clustering first we need to normalize the counts matrix and we will use TPM as normalization measure.

```r
geneLengths <- counts$width

rpk <- apply(subset(counts, select = c(-width)), 2,
              function(x) x/(geneLengths/1000))

tpm <- apply(rpk, 2, function(x) x / sum(as.numeric(x)) * 10^6)

selectedGenes <- names(sort(apply(tpm, 1, var),
                            decreasing = T)[1:100])
pheatmap(tpm[selectedGenes,],
         scale = 'row',
         annotation_col = colData,
         show_rownames = FALSE)
```
