When we do differential analysis in a Rna-seq expreiments we often do it in case vs control setting. We also know the sources of variation between these sample types. These sources of variations can be a drug treatment, certain phenotypic difference (cancerous vs healthy) etc. But on most of occasions we have some known and expected sources or variations such as experiments permormed on different batches, temparature of the day a particular experiments was performed etc. These kinds of variations are not biological rather technical in nature, and may impact the results of an Rna-seq experiment.
