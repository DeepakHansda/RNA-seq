### Explorartory analysis of read count table
+ clustering
  
  It is generally not a good idea to do clustering using all the available genes. It can take lot of time and resources, so instead we do clustering with the help of 100 most variable genes in `tpm` data.
  
  ```r
  # Computing the variance of genes across samples in tpm
  V <- apply(tpm, 1, var)
  
  # sort the V by decreasing order of variance and select top 100 genes.
  
  selectedGenes <- names(V[order(V, decreasing = T)][1:100])
  
  library(pheatmap)
  
  pheatmap(tpm[selectedGenes,], scale = "row", show_rownames = FALSE)
  ```

  We can put some annotations on the heatmap above, primary purpose being to check if the replicates of a sample cluster together or not. Ideally, replicates should cluster together.
  
  ```r
  coldata <- read.table(coldata_file, header = T, sep = '\t',
                      stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
                      
      pheatmap(tpm[selectedGenes,], scale = "row", show_rownames = FALSE, 
         annotation_col = coldata)
 ```

 + Dimensionality reduction: PCA
  
  Apart from heatmap we can also do PCA to confirm if the replicates of a type cluster together. Here too, we should see a clear separation between `CASE` and `CTRL` samples.   
 
 ```r
 # we need to transpose the count matrix, because that is the way a generic PCA calculation function works
 M <- t(tpm[selectedGenes,])
 
 # Making sure the the log function does not have to evaluate a $0$
 
M <- log2(M+1)

pcaResults <- prcomp(M)

pca.plot <- autoplot(pcaResults,
                          data = coldata,
                          colour = 'group')

pca.plot
 ```

+ Correlation plot

Another similar approach to look for the similarity between replicates is to compute the correlation between samples.

```r
library(stats)

correlationMatrix <- cor(tpm)
library(pheatmap)
pheatmap(correlationMatrix, annotation_col = coldata)
```
